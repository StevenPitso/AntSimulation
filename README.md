# 🐜 AntSimulation

Welcome to **AntSimulation** — a fun, slime-mould-inspired ant colony sim! 🌿🍯  
Watch as digital ants explore their world, dodge obstacles, and follow scent trails using virtual pheromones! 💨👃

## 🧠 Inspiration

This quirky project was inspired by the real ants 🐜 that cross my yard every day during recess. Their teamwork and behavior blew my mind — so I recreated it in code!

I used:
- 📚 **Wikipedia** to learn how ants use pheromones to navigate and coordinate
- 🖼️ **PowerPoint** to create my adorable custom ant PNG 🐜✨
- 🔧 **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build the simulation

## 📁 What's in the Folder?

This is the source folder shown in the image! Here's a peek at what you'll find:

- `index.html` — the main entry point 🌐  
- `style.css` — visual design & layout 🎨  
- JavaScript files like `ant.js`, `colony.js`, `pheromone.js`, and more 🧩  
- `Images/` and `Map Generation/` folders for resources 🗺️  
- `README.md` — you're reading it! 📖

## 🧪 Features

- Simulated **pheromone trails** for navigation and coordination 🌀
- Obstacles, food sources, and ant behaviors 🪨🍞
- Modular JS architecture for easy tinkering 🧬

## 🧬 Next Ideas?

Maybe next time...  
🔮 A **particle life simulator** — stay tuned for more weird bio-inspired simulations!
